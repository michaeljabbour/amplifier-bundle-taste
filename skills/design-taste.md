# High-Agency Frontend Skill

## Composition

This is the **BASE** taste skill. It is designed to be composed with one of the archetype overlays — `minimalist-taste`, `brutalist-taste`, `soft-editorial-taste`, `gpt-taste` — or used standalone for a sensible high-end default.

When composed, archetype overlays override conflicting rules from this base (Amplifier `instruction: Replace (later wins)`). The base provides the architecture, performance guardrails, and ban lists; the archetype provides the specific aesthetic dialect (palette, type stack, motion budget, layout posture).

Cross-references for deeper context:

- `@taste:context/dials.md` — full DESIGN_VARIANCE / MOTION_INTENSITY / VISUAL_DENSITY definitions
- `@taste:context/ai-tells-design.md` — extended ban list of generic AI design fingerprints
- `@taste:context/bento-2.md` — the Motion-Engine Bento 2.0 paradigm and 5-card archetypes

## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION
* DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8 (1=Perfect Symmetry, 10=Artsy Chaos)
* MOTION_INTENSITY: 6 (1=Static/No movement, 10=Cinematic/Magic Physics)
* VISUAL_DENSITY: 4 (1=Art Gallery/Airy, 10=Pilot Cockpit/Packed Data)

**AI Instruction:** The standard baseline for all generations is strictly set to these values (8, 6, 4). Do not ask the user to edit this file. Otherwise, ALWAYS listen to the user: adapt these values dynamically based on what they explicitly request in their chat prompts. Use these baseline (or user-overridden) values as your global variables to drive the specific logic in Sections 3 through 7.

## 2. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS
Unless the user explicitly specifies a different stack, adhere to these structural constraints to maintain consistency:

* **DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION [MANDATORY]:** Before importing ANY 3rd party library (e.g. `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `zustand`), you MUST check `package.json`. If the package is missing, you MUST output the installation command (e.g. `npm install package-name`) before providing the code. **Never** assume a library exists.
* **Framework & Interactivity:** React or Next.js. Default to Server Components (`RSC`). 
    * **RSC SAFETY:** Global state works ONLY in Client Components. In Next.js, wrap providers in a `"use client"` component.
    * **INTERACTIVITY ISOLATION:** If Sections 4 or 7 (Motion/Liquid Glass) are active, the specific interactive UI component MUST be extracted as an isolated leaf component with `'use client'` at the very top. Server Components must exclusively render static layouts.
* **State Management:** Use local `useState`/`useReducer` for isolated UI. Use global state strictly for deep prop-drilling avoidance.
* **Styling Policy:** Use Tailwind CSS (v3/v4) for 90% of styling. 
    * **TAILWIND VERSION LOCK:** Check `package.json` first. Do not use v4 syntax in v3 projects. 
    * **T4 CONFIG GUARD:** For v4, do NOT use `tailwindcss` plugin in `postcss.config.js`. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` or the Vite plugin.
* **ANTI-EMOJI POLICY [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use emojis in code, markup, text content, or alt text. Replace symbols with high-quality icons (Radix, Phosphor) or clean SVG primitives. Emojis are BANNED.
* **Responsiveness & Spacing:**
  * Standardize breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
  * Contain page layouts using `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or `max-w-7xl`.
  * **Viewport Stability [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent catastrophic layout jumping on mobile browsers (iOS Safari).
  * **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`) for reliable structures.
* **Icons:** You MUST use exactly `@phosphor-icons/react` or `@radix-ui/react-icons` as the import paths (check installed version). Standardize `strokeWidth` globally (e.g., exclusively use `1.5` or `2.0`).


## 3. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)
LLMs have statistical biases toward specific UI cliché patterns. Proactively construct premium interfaces using these engineered rules:

**Rule 1: Deterministic Typography**
* **Display/Headlines:** Default to `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.
    * **ANTI-SLOP:** Discourage `Inter` for "Premium" or "Creative" vibes. Force unique character using `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`.
    * **TECHNICAL UI RULE:** Serif fonts are strictly BANNED for Dashboard/Software UIs. For these contexts, use exclusively high-end Sans-Serif pairings (`Geist` + `Geist Mono` or `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`).
* **Body/Paragraphs:** Default to `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.

**Rule 2: Color Calibration**
* **Constraint:** Max 1 Accent Color. Saturation < 80%.
* **THE LILA BAN:** The "AI Purple/Blue" aesthetic is strictly BANNED. No purple button glows, no neon gradients. Use absolute neutral bases (Zinc/Slate) with high-contrast, singular accents (e.g. Emerald, Electric Blue, or Deep Rose).
* **COLOR CONSISTENCY:** Stick to one palette for the entire output. Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.

**Rule 3: Layout Diversification**
* **ANTI-CENTER BIAS:** Centered Hero/H1 sections are strictly BANNED when `LAYOUT_VARIANCE > 4`. Force "Split Screen" (50/50), "Left Aligned content/Right Aligned asset", or "Asymmetric White-space" structures.

**Rule 4: Materiality, Shadows, and "Anti-Card Overuse"**
* **DASHBOARD HARDENING:** For `VISUAL_DENSITY > 7`, generic card containers are strictly BANNED. Use logic-grouping via `border-t`, `divide-y`, or purely negative space. Data metrics should breathe without being boxed in unless elevation (z-index) is functionally required.
* **Execution:** Use cards ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy. When a shadow is used, tint it to the background hue.

**Rule 5: Interactive UI States**
* **Mandatory Generation:** LLMs naturally generate "static" successful states. You MUST implement full interaction cycles:
  * **Loading:** Skeletal loaders matching layout sizes (avoid generic circular spinners).
  * **Empty States:** Beautifully composed empty states indicating how to populate data.
  * **Error States:** Clear, inline error reporting (e.g., forms).
  * **Tactile Feedback:** On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push indicating success/action.

**Rule 6: Data & Form Patterns**
* **Forms:** Label MUST sit above input. Helper text is optional but should exist in markup. Error text below input. Use a standard `gap-2` for input blocks.

## 4. CREATIVE PROACTIVITY (Anti-Slop Implementation)
To actively combat generic AI designs, systematically implement these high-end coding concepts as your baseline:
* **"Liquid Glass" Refraction:** When glassmorphism is needed, go beyond `backdrop-blur`. Add a 1px inner border (`border-white/10`) and a subtle inner shadow (`shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1)]`) to simulate physical edge refraction.
* **Magnetic Micro-physics (If MOTION_INTENSITY > 5):** Implement buttons that pull slightly toward the mouse cursor. **CRITICAL:** NEVER use React `useState` for magnetic hover or continuous animations. Use EXCLUSIVELY Framer Motion's `useMotionValue` and `useTransform` outside the React render cycle to prevent performance collapse on mobile.
* **Perpetual Micro-Interactions:** When `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5`, embed continuous, infinite micro-animations (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer, Carousel) in standard components (avatars, status dots, backgrounds). Apply premium Spring Physics (`type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`) to all interactive elements—no linear easing.
* **Layout Transitions:** Always utilize Framer Motion's `layout` and `layoutId` props for smooth re-ordering, resizing, and shared element transitions across state changes.
* **Staggered Orchestration:** Do not mount lists or grids instantly. Use `staggerChildren` (Framer) or CSS cascade (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 100ms)`) to create sequential waterfall reveals. **CRITICAL:** For `staggerChildren`, the Parent (`variants`) and Children MUST reside in the identical Client Component tree. If data is fetched asynchronously, pass the data as props into a centralized Parent Motion wrapper.

## 5. PERFORMANCE GUARDRAILS
* **DOM Cost:** Apply grain/noise filters exclusively to fixed, pointer-event-none pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-50 pointer-events-none`) and NEVER to scrolling containers to prevent continuous GPU repaints and mobile performance degradation.
* **Hardware Acceleration:** Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height`. Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`.
* **Z-Index Restraint:** NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10` unprompted. Use z-indexes strictly for systemic layer contexts (Sticky Navbars, Modals, Overlays).

## 6. TECHNICAL REFERENCE (Dial Definitions)

The 3 parametric dials (DESIGN_VARIANCE, MOTION_INTENSITY, VISUAL_DENSITY) and
their threshold-driven branching logic are defined in
`@taste:context/dials.md`. Treat that file as authoritative — these dials act
as global session variables.

## 7. AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)

The full ban list of generic AI design fingerprints — visual/CSS, typography,
layout/spacing, content/data ("Jane Doe" effect), and external resources — is
maintained in `@taste:context/ai-tells-design.md`. Treat that file as
authoritative for forbidden patterns.

## 8. THE CREATIVE ARSENAL (High-End Inspiration)

**CRITICAL boundary rule:** Never mix GSAP/ThreeJS with Framer Motion in the
same component tree. Default to Framer Motion for UI/Bento interactions. Use
GSAP (ScrollTrigger/Parallax) and ThreeJS/WebGL EXCLUSIVELY for isolated
full-page scrolltelling or canvas backgrounds, wrapped in strict `useEffect`
cleanup blocks. They have incompatible animation lifecycles and will produce
subtle layout bugs if mixed in the same subtree.

The detailed pattern reference (40+ named premium UI patterns across 8
categories) lives in `@taste:context/creative-arsenal.md`. The categories are:

- **The Standard Hero Paradigm** — asymmetric Hero alternative to centered-text-over-dark-image.
- **Navigation & Menüs** — Mac OS Dock Magnification, Gooey Menu, Dynamic Island, Magnetic Button, etc.
- **Layout & Grids** — Bento Grid, Masonry Layout, Chroma Grid, Split Screen Scroll, Curtain Reveal.
- **Cards & Containers** — Parallax Tilt Card, Spotlight Border Card, Glassmorphism Panel, Holographic Foil Card, Morphing Modal, etc.
- **Scroll-Animations** — Sticky Scroll Stack, Horizontal Scroll Hijack, Locomotive Scroll Sequence, Zoom Parallax, Liquid Swipe Transition, etc.
- **Galleries & Media** — Dome Gallery, Coverflow Carousel, Drag-to-Pan Grid, Hover Image Trail, Glitch Effect Image, etc.
- **Typography & Text** — Kinetic Marquee, Text Mask Reveal, Text Scramble, Circular Text Path, Kinetic Typography Grid, etc.
- **Micro-Interactions & Effects** — Particle Explosion Button, Skeleton Shimmer, Ripple Click, Mesh Gradient Background, Lens Blur Depth, etc.

Browse `@taste:context/creative-arsenal.md` for specific patterns when an
archetype overlay calls for one or when you need ambient inspiration.
Archetype-specific bans in `@taste:context/ai-tells-design.md` override the
arsenal's "available" list.


## 9. THE "MOTION-ENGINE" BENTO PARADIGM

The Bento 2.0 architecture — core design philosophy, animation engine specs
(Framer Motion spring physics, layout transitions, infinite loops), and the 5
card archetypes (Intelligent List, Command Input, Live Status, Wide Data
Stream, Contextual UI) — is defined in `@taste:context/bento-2.md`. Treat
that file as authoritative when generating Bento dashboards.

## 10. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK
Evaluate your code against this matrix before outputting. This is the **last** filter you apply to your logic.
- [ ] Is global state used appropriately to avoid deep prop-drilling rather than arbitrarily?
- [ ] Is mobile layout collapse (`w-full`, `px-4`, `max-w-7xl mx-auto`) guaranteed for high-variance designs?
- [ ] Do full-height sections safely use `min-h-[100dvh]` instead of the bugged `h-screen`?
- [ ] Do `useEffect` animations contain strict cleanup functions?
- [ ] Are empty, loading, and error states provided?
- [ ] Are cards omitted in favor of spacing where possible?
- [ ] Did you strictly isolate CPU-heavy perpetual animations in their own Client Components?
